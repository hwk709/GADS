## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:

### Part 1: Python Data Types
 
- Discuss Python as a programming language.
- Define integers, strings, tuples, lists, and dictionaries.
- Demonstrate arithmetic operations and string operations.
- Demonstrate variable assignment. 

### Part 2: Python Iteration, Control Flows, and Functions
 
- Define `Python` control flow and conditional programming.  
- Implement `for` and `while` loops to iterate through data structures.
- Apply `if, else` conditional statements.
- Create functions to perform repetitive actions.
- Demonstrate error handling using `try, except` statements.
- Use `Python` control flow and functions to help us parse, clean, edit and analyze data sets.

## Student Requirements

Before this lesson(s), students should already be able to:
- Recall and define common Python data types.

## Lesson Outline

> Note: Loops and functions may be challenging for newer practicioners. However they give us ALOT of power to manipulate data and create powerful models. I added some practice links to the class resources and I highly recommend finding additional time to become familiar with these concepts.

**Part 1 : Python Data Types**
- Why Python?
- Introduction to Data Types
- Jupyter Notebook
- Python Variables
- Operators
- Integers and Floats
- Strings
- Lists
- Tuples
- Dictionaries
- Importing Packages and Documentation

**Part 2 : Python Iterations, Control Flow, and Functions**
- If... Else Statements
- Iterating With For Loops
- Functions
- While Loops
- Practice control flow on Coffee Preference data set (if time remains, otherwise practice at home)
