From the numerator, covariance would be positive if, for all pairs of data points, $(x_i - \\bar{X})$ and $(y_i - \\bar{Y})$ are 1) both positive or 2) both negative. This occurs when: 1) Both data points are greather than their respective means. Or when: 2) Both data points are less than their respective means!
